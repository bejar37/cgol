Requires pygame.

Simple Conway's Game of Life implementation.
To run, execute cgol_view.py.

You can toggle if a square is 'dead' or 'alive' by left clicking on it. On right
clicking the board, the simulation begins. You can pause/restart the simulation
at any time by right clicking the board. When the simulation is paused, you can
also choose to alter its current state by setting more blocks to be dead or
alive.
